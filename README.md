# theatredeparis

This is a repository for public-domain theatrical texts from Paris.  The first batch is a random one percent sample (31 plays) from the first volume of Charles Beaumont Wicks's *The Parisian Stage*, [described in more detail here](http://grieve-smith.com/blog/stage/).  Of these plays, 24 are available, and 15 have been OCRed and cleaned.

These texts are all out of copyright, and are distributed here for the purposes of entertainment or scientific inquiry.  I encourage you to submit pull requests with texts from the remaining 9 plays, or with corrected errors, or to fork this repository and convert the files to TEI or Markdown or any other format you like.

The plays in the sample are listed in [a CSV file](https://github.com/grvsmth/theatredeparis/blob/master/napoleonicSample.csv).  The fifteen plays that have been OCRed and cleaned are in [the texts directory](https:texts).
